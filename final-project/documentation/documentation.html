          Here is the wireframe for my website.
        </p>

        <p>
          Before I even do any coding, I need more experience with Tone.js.
        </p>
        <p>
          As mentioned in my <a href="https://camillah44.github.io/final-project/documentation/proposal.html">proposal</a>, I've already seen a little of what Tone.js can do, but I've barely scratched the surface. 
        </p>
        <p>
          That's where these tutorials came in handy:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftGuDvm5zDQ">First Tutorial</a>
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZhbKclhDf4">Second Tutorial</a>
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCNRRag2GgE">Third Tutorial</a>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>These tutorials by The Code Creative on Youtube were extremely easy to follow, and make Tone.js seem much more approachable.</p>
        <p>Following along with them, I was able to create this code:</p>
        <p>
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/camillah44/719f28a6ee725efcdf7b9ff88bee6aca.js"></script>
        </p>
        <p>You can see the results of this code <a href="https://camillah44.github.io/final-project/progress/day1.html">here</a>.</p>
        <p>(Personal Notes for the future:)
          <ul>
            <li>Change the typeface for the paragraph text. The readability with this one isn't great.</li>
            <li>Consider switching from ems to rems on the ul and p divs. There have been some complications with the formatting because of them.</li>
            <li>For next session: Explore new synths, use polySynth, and create a phrase with multiple notes.</li>
          </ul></p>

        Day Two
      </h2>
      <section>
        <p>Since I made a fairly simple sound last time, today I'm going to expand and hopefully experiment with different synths, chords, and phrases.</p>
        <p>If all goes well timewise, I hope to start transposing Married Life into code. (I'm not holding out hope, so you shouldn't either, but we'll have to see.)</p>
        <p>...</p>
        <video width="100%" height="" controls>
          <source src="images/daytwodemonstration.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        </video>
        <p>So here's what I did in video form, in case you don't want to bother to visit my <a href="https://camillah44.github.io/final-project/progress/day1.html">example website</a>.</p>
        <p>I'm not going to show you the code cause it's a bit of a mess, but I will explain what I did to get to this point.</p>
        <p>Using this <a href="https://www.devbridge.com/articles/tonejs-coding-music-production-guide/">tutorial</a> and a bit of trial and error, I used a polySynth to create a chord.</p> 
        <p>This tutorial was nice, and I connected with the author's enthusiasm for the integration of music into coding, but since I don't know much JavaScript, I was in over my head here.</p>
        <p>However, the one new piece of info I firmly grasped was that in order to play multiple notes at once, you have to use an array, so that's what I did.</p>
        <p>Next I made a sequencer. Do not ask me what that is I barely know.</p>
        <p>I watched a bunch of tutorials but they were all sort of useless, but you can see the sort of useless one I stole the actual sequence from <a href="https://medium.com/geekculture/creating-a-step-sequencer-with-tone-js-32ea3002aaf5">here</a>.</p>
        <p>There are a few immediate problems I'm noticing, #1 is that I sort of stil don't understand sequencers, but the bigger fish I have to fry, #2 is that I don't know how to pause the sequence, but that's a problem for another day cause I am so done lol. </p>
        <p>(Personal Notes for the future:)
          <ul>
            <li>Change the typeface for the paragraph text. The readability with this one isn't great.</li>
            <li>Consider switching from ems to rems on the ul and p divs. There have been some complications with the formatting because of them.</li>
            <li>For next session: Explore new synths, use polySynth, and create a phrase with multiple notes. (Completed)</li>

        Day Three
      </h2>
      <section>
        <p>Before I get into anything new, the typeface I chose for the paragraphs was really hard for me to read, so I chose a new one. (I can't decide if I like it, might change it again, but at least it's legible).</p>
        <p>Today, instead of solving the problems I encountered last time, I'm ignoring them (story of my life).</p>
        <p>I think it makes more sense right now to focus on what I actually can do, so I'm going to input the sheet music for Married Life into a website, using multiple sequencers. Wish me luck.</p>
        <p>...</p>
        <p>I ran into some difficulty.</p>
        <p>...</p>
        <p>I know I said that I would focus on putting the music into Tone.js, but I really wanted to fix the sequencer so that it would not continuously play.</p>
        <p>I tried using this <a href="https://medium.com/geekculture/creating-a-step-sequencer-with-tone-js-32ea3002aaf5">tutorial</a> to create a play/pause button, but I just could not get it to work.</p>
        <p>You can find the gist for my non-functional code down below or view it <a href="https://gist.github.com/camillah44/f2286c8db91b0ca6fb7d3d5734875146">here</a>.</p>
        <p>
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/camillah44/f2286c8db91b0ca6fb7d3d5734875146.js"></script>
        </p>
        <p>In the comments of the code I outline what I tried to do to fix it, though ultimately I wasn't successful.</p>
        <p>At this point I'm tired and confused. I want to try adding in the song, but I don't want it to live in a broken home, so I'll come back tomorrow.</p>

      <section>
        <p>Today was my first time getting user feedback in class.</p>
        <p>There wasn't a whole lot for others to test, but I did get some suggestions on how to make this work.</p>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Try looking up conditional if/else statements.</li>
            <li>Try using different mouse elements to play or pause.</li>
            <li>
              Try having the visuals change according to the chord playing.
              (This one was not for problem-solving, but to make things more interesting.)
            </li>
            <li>
              I like the background color. 
              (Thanks.)
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>After deliberating on the feedback I got from my classmates, in true me fashion, I ignored them all.</p>
        <p>Instead, I looked back at this <a href="https://peteronuz.github.io/week11/week11.html">website</a> Peter made for his McLuhan response.</p>
        <p>When you click on the red text, it changes. This is exactly what I wanted for my website, but with audio instead of words.</p>
        <p>After playing with the <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/7N5K5/2/">code</a> Peter used, I understood that I wanted to "change the div" on every click.</p>
        <p>At this point, I realized that Tone.js was probably a no-go.</p>
        <p>I know that it was one of my goals to learn it, but I think that was only because I thought I had to use it for this to work. Now, I'm realizing 
          that MP3s would probably work just as well, if not better, for what I'm doing.</p>
        <p>Therefore, I'm officially shedding Tone.js in favor of MP3s.</p>
        <p>Anyway, none of the searches I tried would get me close to changing the content of a div with anything but text, so I had to keep digging.</p>
        <p class="img-container">
          <img src="images/append-ex1.png">
          <img src="images/append-ex2.png">
        </p>
        <p>When I found the appendChild() Method, this was even closer. In fact, this is exactly what I want to do visually when my song plays.</p>
        <p>The only issue is that the content that appends is always the same - a div that says "Water".</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, it brings me much closer to my goal, visually and auditorily, because it helps me understand the structure of JavaScript better.</p>
        <p>...</p>
        <p>I thought I was a lot closer to finding out how to make my idea work at this point, but I was wrong.</p>
        <p>I tried many Google searches like "making dynamic divs" or "how to change the content of a variable every time you click" or blah blah blah.</p>
        <p>None of them worked, so I'm giving up for the day. Hopefully things will work out tomorrow.</p>

        <p>...It is tomorrow...</p>
        <p>sigh</p>
        <p>Back to the grind.</p>
        <p>...</p>
        <p>...</p>
        <p>...</p>
        <p>Huzzah!</p>
        <p>The grind has uncovered thine coveted answers.</p>
        <p>I was FaceTiming my sister when I got bored and I had an idea.</p>
        <p>I remember Lana telling me during class to look up if/else statements, and at this point, it was my last hope, so I typed into the search bar "how to use if else statements to play a different function every click" and under the fourth link I found this <a href="https://www.sololearn.com/Discuss/1618462/how-do-you-execute-a-different-function-each-time-the-same-button-is-clicked-in-javascript">beauty</a>:</p>
        <p class="img-container">
          <img src="images/huzzah.png">
        </p>
        <p>Clicking on that link brought me to the exact code I needed in order to change the audio every time you click.</p>
        <p>I had to circle around the room victoriously a couple of time after finding this code. (It's seriously so perfect. I can even copy the whole thing directly and experiment with it right there. My angel TT)</p>
        <p>You can find the original code <a href="https://www.sololearn.com/compiler-playground/WWXqYfP2FVEK/?ref=app">here</a>.</p>
