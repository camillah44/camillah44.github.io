        Day One

        <p>
          Before I even do any coding, I need more experience with Tone.js.
        </p>
        <p>
          As mentioned in my <a href="https://camillah44.github.io/final-project/documentation/proposal.html">proposal</a>, I've already seen a little of what Tone.js can do, but I've barely scratched the surface. 
        </p>
        <p>
          That's where these tutorials came in handy:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftGuDvm5zDQ">First Tutorial</a>
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZhbKclhDf4">Second Tutorial</a>
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCNRRag2GgE">Third Tutorial</a>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>These tutorials by The Code Creative on Youtube were extremely easy to follow, and make Tone.js seem much more approachable.</p>
        <p>Following along with them, I was able to create this code:</p>
        <p>
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/camillah44/719f28a6ee725efcdf7b9ff88bee6aca.js"></script>
        </p>
        <p>You can see the results of this code <a href="https://camillah44.github.io/final-project/progress/day1.html">here</a>.</p>
        <p>(Personal Notes for the future:)
          <ul>
            <li>Change the typeface for the paragraph text. The readability with this one isn't great.</li>
            <li>Consider switching from ems to rems on the ul and p divs. There have been some complications with the formatting because of them.</li>
            <li>For next session: Explore new synths, use polySynth, and create a phrase with multiple notes.</li>
          </ul></p>

        Day Two
      </h2>
      <section>
        <p>Since I made a fairly simple sound last time, today I'm going to expand and hopefully experiment with different synths, chords, and phrases.</p>
        <p>If all goes well timewise, I hope to start transposing Married Life into code. (I'm not holding out hope, so you shouldn't either, but we'll have to see.)</p>
        <p>...</p>

        </video>
        <p>So here's what I did in video form, in case you don't want to bother to visit my <a href="https://camillah44.github.io/final-project/progress/day1.html">example website</a>.</p>
        <p>I'm not going to show you the code cause it's a bit of a mess, but I will explain what I did to get to this point.</p>
        <p>Using this <a href="https://www.devbridge.com/articles/tonejs-coding-music-production-guide/">tutorial</a> and a bit of trial and error, I used a polySynth to create a chord.</p> 
        <p>This tutorial was nice, and I connected with the author's enthusiasm for the integration of music into coding, but since I don't know much JavaScript, I was in over my head here.</p>
        <p>However, the one new piece of info I firmly grasped was that in order to play multiple notes at once, you have to use an array, so that's what I did.</p>
        <p>Next I made a sequencer. Do not ask me what that is I barely know.</p>
        <p>I watched a bunch of tutorials but they were all sort of useless, but you can see the sort of useless one I stole the actual sequence from <a href="https://medium.com/geekculture/creating-a-step-sequencer-with-tone-js-32ea3002aaf5">here</a>.</p>
        <p>There are a few immediate problems I'm noticing, #1 is that I sort of stil don't understand sequencers, but the bigger fish I have to fry, #2 is that I don't know how to pause the sequence, but that's a problem for another day cause I am so done lol. </p>
        <p>(Personal Notes for the future:)
          <ul>
            <li>Change the typeface for the paragraph text. The readability with this one isn't great.</li>
            <li>Consider switching from ems to rems on the ul and p divs. There have been some complications with the formatting because of them.</li>
            <li>For next session: Explore new synths, use polySynth, and create a phrase with multiple notes. (Completed)</li>

        Day Three
      </h2>
      <section>
        <p>Before I get into anything new, the typeface I chose for the paragraphs was really hard for me to read, so I chose a new one. (I can't decide if I like it, might change it again, but at least it's legible).</p>
        <p>Today, instead of solving the problems I encountered last time, I'm ignoring them (story of my life).</p>
        <p>I think it makes more sense right now to focus on what I actually can do, so I'm going to input the sheet music for Married Life into a website, using multiple sequencers. Wish me luck.</p>
