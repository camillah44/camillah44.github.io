    Aureia Harvey's art doesn't scream "digital" at me. I mean this in a good way. 
    I had to take a second glance at the images of her art shown in this article, 
    because it was so realistic I couldn't even believe it was digital for a moment.
    After glancing through her exhibited work, I could tell she is a pioneer in the 
    world of digital art, and I'm excited to see where her professional career goes.

      "A lot of digital artists are probably feeling the same way about the art world now 
      — that we don’t need them [non-digital artists]."

      I was honestly shocked by this comment. I think there's still a lot of stigma 
      around digital art. I've found that many traditional artists don't consider
      digital art to be on par with traditional mediums (which I don't agree with). 
      I never thought about this from the digital art perspective, or considered that
      digital artists might find traditional art to be obsolete.
